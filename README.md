## Installation
You have two options to install Edpuzzle+, either installing it through the chrome web store (RECOMMENDED) or installing it locally.

### Installing it on the Chrome Web Store
The first and most straight forward option is to install Edpuzzle+ on the chrome web store. This way, all updates made to Edpuzzle+ are automatically updated on your extension, and all you have to do is click one button.

1. Make sure you have google chrome installed
2. Click [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/edpuzzle%2B/gkkdeienfnphnhkhineemgfapbjeakob) to go directly to the extension link on the chrome web store, or head to http://chrome.google.com/webstore and in the search bar, type "Edpuzzle+". Do not trust any other extension that claims to be "Edpuzzle+" if it is not made by Peridax.
3. Click the "Add to chrome" button, and that's it!

### Installing it locally
1. At the top of this github page click the green "Clone or download" button.
2. Once prompted with options, click "Download ZIP".
3. Once the download is completed, click on it, or click "Show in folder".
4. Extract the files to some place you will remember, you can just right click on the compressed folder and click "Extract here".
5. Go back to google chrome, open a new tab and type in **chrome://extensions**.
6. Once you are at the chrome extensions page, make sure developer mode is enabled in the top right corner.
7. Click "Load unpacked" in the top left hand corner, and select the folder that you extracted in step 4. You can also simply drag the folder into the chrome extensions tab.
8. Once loaded in, you're all set and Edpuzzle+ is up and running.

If Edpuzzle+ is installed locally, you can now make any addition to the extension that you would like.
